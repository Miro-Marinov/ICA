# ICA

Paper: https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahyvarin/papers/NN00new.pdf


Three .wav files are mixed together. Then ICA is used in an attempt to disambiguate the three sounds from each other.


A - The mixing matrix

x1,x2,x3 - The sound data for the 3 separate wav sounds

x - matrix containing the three mixed wavs

[S,w] - S contains the pure signals and w the unmixing matrix


Use the sound command to listen to each vector and clear sound to stop the sound.
