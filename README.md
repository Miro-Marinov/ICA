Paper: https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahyvarin/papers/NN00new.pdf

The three .wav files are mixed into together and then the algorihm would try to separate them. In order to test it run TestICA.m

A - mixing matrix
x1,x2,x3 - pure sounds
x - matrix containing the three mixed wavs
[S,w] - S contains the pure signals and w the unmixing matrix

Use the sound command to listen to each vector and clear sound to stop the sound.
